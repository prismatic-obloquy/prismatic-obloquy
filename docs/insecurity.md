Have you found an issue with the security of *any* of my projects?
Please [email me] as soon as you can!

Try to include:

* The project it's in
* The symptoms of the issue
* The conditions needed to trigger the issue
* If you've done any further analysis, the root cause
* If it's a software issue, what part of the software, ideally narrowed down to a function
* If it's a design issue, what parts of the design interact to break

If you're missing any of that, it's fine, and I still appreciate the report.
It'll just take me longer to find and fix the issue.

Finally, please be patient.
I know it's frustrating to report an issue and not get a response back, but I'm an individual with a full-time job besides working on these projects.
It may take me a couple days to get back to you, and longer still to get a fix out.

Thanks!
