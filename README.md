I'm [Prismatic] [Obloquy], Prisoblo if you want a weird non-word, or Prob for something that's vaguely a name.
I do cybersecurity, mostly.
If you're very good, you can probably find me elsewhere, and if you do, I'll see you on the other side.
Alternatively, enjoy [my blog], maybe explore [some demos], maybe [learn some coding].
(And if any of those links don't work, be patient; they will soon.)
